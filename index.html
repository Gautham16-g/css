        <p>Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do. Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites. Coders, or programmers,
          are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer.</p>

        <h3>PLAYING GAMES</h3>
        <p>Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience
          of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. Often, part of the entertainment for children
          playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.</p>
